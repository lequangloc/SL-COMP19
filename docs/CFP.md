# CALL FOR COMMENTS AND PARTICIPANTS
# SL-COMP'19
## 3rd International Competition of Solvers on Separation Logic
## at TOOLympics 2019
## http://sl-comp.github.io

The Separation Logic Competition (SL-COMP) is an initiative to bring together 
researchers and practitioners interested on improving the state of the art of 
automated deduction methods for Separation Logic. The event took place
two times until now and collected more than 1K decision problems 
for different theories of Separation Logic. The solvers are compared on each 
theory and using the same computing platform, so that a fair comparison is made. 

SL-COMP 2018 collected a set of 1296 problems covering satisfiability
and entailment problems. Ten solvers have been involved. 
The contributors exchanged on the new format, the benchmark problems 
and the results during the ADSL workshop at FLOC 2018.

SL-COMP 2019 is an invited event of TOOLympics 2019, which 
will gather a dozen of competitions to celebrate their 
achievements in the field of Tools and Algorithms for the 
Construction and Analysis of System (TACAS).
SL-COMP 2019 will run on the existing set of problems on
the StarExec platform.


## CALL FOR SOLVERS

For the 2019 edition, we ask developers of SL solvers to register 
by providing up to 2 pages (LNCS style) describing the solver on
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=slcomp19
The contributions will be integrated in a common paper describing 
SL-COMP to be inserted in the 25th anniversary proceedings of TACAS. 
The solver description shall include: 
- solver name and team,
- the SL fragment dealt and an overview of the theoretical
  aspects on which the solver is built; references to the
  papers that describe the theoretical details,
- solver architecture (implementation language and 
  libraries used, input parser, pre-processor, etc.)
- strengths and weaknesses of the approach from the
  evaluation on the SL-COMP benchmarks,
- contact information, information about the project
  (development page, contributors, institutions)

We expect that participants of previous editions will join 
the 2019 edition. 

It is useful for the organizing committee to know in advance 
how many solvers may be entering. Thus, we request 
that you let us know as soon as possible (and before
the deadline) if you think you may submit a solver to SL-COMP'19.

Competition first run (expected)     8  March,   2019
