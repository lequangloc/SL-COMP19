# Cyclist-SL #

\CYCLIST~\cite{BrotherstonGP12,CYCLISTsite}
was submitted by
Nikos Gorogiannis (Middlesex University London, UK) in 2014.
The solver deals with the entailment checking for the |QF_SLID| fragment.
It is an instantiation of the theorem prover \CYCLIST\ for the case of Separation Logic with inductive definitions.
The solver builds derivation trees and uses induction to cut infinite paths in these trees
that satisfy some soundness condition.
For the Separation Logic, \CYCLIST\ replaces the rule of weakening used in first-order theorem provers with the frame rule of SL.

\CYCLIST\ won the division |qf_slid_entl| in 2014 and was at the second place in the same division in 2018.
